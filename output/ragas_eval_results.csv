By focusing on relabeling, annotating, and refining old data, companies were able to extract more meaningful insights and train their models using simulated scenarios that mimic real-world edge cases. This approach could lead to more robust and adaptable learning systems that can perform better under diverse conditions and unusual situations, bolstering the reliability of self-driving technology. For future scalability, this shift implies a more sustainable model for development that leverages data as a renewable resource, allowing developers to continuously improve their systems without being entirely dependent on costly and logistically challenging real-world data collection.

Cohere’s Aya Vision beats multilingual rivals in text & image understanding
Multilingual AI models often suffer uneven performance across languages, especially in multimodal tasks. A pair of lean models counters this trend with consistent understanding of text and images across major languages.

What’s new: A team at Cohere led by Saurabh Dash released Aya Vision , a family of multilingual vision-language models with downloadable weights in 8 billion- and 32-billion-parameter sizes.

• Input/output: Text and images in (up to 2,197 image tokens, up to 16,000 tokens total), text out (up to 4,000 tokens).

• Availability: Free via WhatsApp or Cohere Playground . Weights available to download, but licensed only for noncommercial uses.

• Features: Multilingual input and output in 23 languages.

• Undisclosed: Knowledge cutoff, training datasets, adapter architecture.

How it works: Each model comprises a pretrained large language model (Aya Expanse for the 32B model, C4AI Command R7B for the 8B version), a pretrained vision encoder (SigLIP 2), and a vision-language adapter (“connector”) of unspecified architecture.

• To establish basic vision-language understanding, the team froze the vision encoder and language model and trained the vision-language connector.

• They fine-tuned the vision-language connector and language model on multimodal tasks. To build the fine-tuning dataset, they generated synthetic annotations for various English-language datasets and translated a large amount of data into a variety of languages. They rephrased the translations to add fluency and variety, particularly for languages with little real-world data, by matching generated pairs with the original synthetic samples.

• They merged the language model with the fine-tuned vision-language model using an undisclosed method that preserved text capabilities while adding vision understanding.

• After proving this method for 8 billion parameters, they scaled up the recipe to 32 billion parameters.

Performance: To test the model, the team built and released two benchmarks: m-WildVision , a multilingual version of Wild Vision Bench ’s arena-style competition for discussion of images, and AyaVisionBench , 135 image-question pairs in each language that cover nine tasks including captioning images, understanding charts, recognizing characters in images, visual reasoning, and converting screenshots to code.

We look forward to a world in which understanding any scene or document is as effortless in Swahili as it is in English.","In the fine-tuning process of the Aya Vision model, synthetic data plays a crucial role in establishing a foundational understanding across multiple languages, including those with limited real-world data. The generation of synthetic annotations allows the model to access a variety of training samples in multiple languages without the need for large, manually labeled datasets. This is especially important for low-resource languages where such datasets are scarce or non-existent. Rephrasing translations adds fluency and variety by ensuring that translations don't just mirror the source language but capture native-like expressions and colloquialisms. This helps the model develop a more nuanced understanding and more natural interactions in these languages.

The advantages of this approach include the ability to scale up training data efficiently across languages and the flexibility to adapt synthetic data generation processes to the specific linguistic characteristics of each language. However, limitations arise from the accuracy and quality of the synthetic data itself; if the initial data or the rephrasings are flawed, those errors may propagate. Additionally, reliance on synthetic data means that the model's understanding might not be as deep as it would be with genuine real-world data, potentially leading to brittleness in edge cases.

This approach could offer advantages in scenarios where maintaining a logical and stylistic flow throughout the image is crucial—such as generating coherent scenes in narrative artwork or ensuring consistency when producing related image series. However, this same characteristic can also introduce limitations, particularly in dealing with fine-grained details or rendering highly complex scenes. Because each part relies on previously generated parts, any errors or artifacts are propagated through the generation process, potentially affecting overall image fidelity more so than in diffusion models, which often involve iterative refinement processes to slowly approach a final result.

This move parallels the strategy employed by Apple and Google with their app stores, which significantly contributed to the entrenchment and widespread adoption of their platforms. Several elements of the store's design contribute to this strategy:

1. **Curated Marketplace**: By curating and organizing GPTs into categories such as education, productivity, and more, and highlighting ""featured"" and ""trending"" GPTs, OpenAI ensures that users can easily discover valuable and relevant applications, thus enhancing user engagement and satisfaction.

2. **Searchability and Discoverability**: The ability to search for GPTs by keywords allows users to find specific tools that meet their needs, thereby increasing the utility and appeal of the platform.

3. **User-Created Content**: By enabling users to create and list their own GPTs, OpenAI taps into the creativity and expertise of its users, broadening the range of available applications and fostering innovation within the community.

4. **Revenue-Sharing Program**: Though details are scarce, a future revenue-sharing program incentivizes creators to produce high-quality GPTs, potentially leading to a rich and diverse catalog of applications that drive more users to the platform.

"How did the authors of the DINOv2 model ensure that the dataset used for pretraining was both large and diverse, and why was this considered a key insight for successfully enhancing the model's performance on various vision tasks?","['Multitask Vision Transformer\n\nThe original DINO showed that a vision transformer pretrained on unlabeled images could learn representations that were sufficient for classifying and segmenting images. In an update of that work, the model learned representations useful in a wider variety of tasks.\n\nWhat’s new: Maxime Oquab, Timothée Darcet, Théo Moutakanni, and colleagues at Meta and France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology released DINOv2 , a vision transformer pretrained in a self-supervised manner that performs video classification, image retrieval, depth estimation and other vision tasks.\n\nKey insight: Datasets of images scraped from the web can be very large, but they can also be surprisingly undiverse (for example, mostly pictures of pets). Images from smaller datasets that are known to be diverse can be used to find similar images on the web. In this way, it’s possible to scrape a large, diverse image dataset to train vision models using self-supervised methods.\n\nHow it works: The authors gathered 142 million images with diversity similar to curated data sets. They pretrained DINOv2, a large vision transformer (ViT) to embed the images using two loss functions gleaned from previous work.\n\n• The authors started with 1.2 billion uncurated images. They used smaller curated datasets such as ImageNet-22k (14.2 million images), ImageNet-1k (1.2 million), and Google Landmarks (4.1 million) to select a certain number of similar ones. They considered two images to be similar based on the cosine-similarity of embeddings computed by ViT-H/16 pretrained on ImageNet-22k.\n\n• Following the original DINO , the authors compared DINOv2’s classification to a teacher model’s classification. Specifically, they added an extra vanilla neural network and pretrained DINOv2 to match its classification of a cropped image to the teacher’s classification of a different crop of the same image. The teacher’s weights were the exponential moving average (average where the most recent versions matter exponentially more than the past ones) of iterations of DINOv2 earlier in the training process.\n\n• Following iBOT , they added a second vanilla neural network and pretrained DINOv2 to match its embeddings of a masked image’s patches to the teacher’s embeddings of the unmasked image’s patches.\n\n• Training on such a large image dataset took a lot of time, so the authors devised 9 methods to accelerate pretraining. For instance, they trained DINOv2 on images at low resolution (224 by 224 pixels) for most of the process. To enable DINOv2 to learn image details, they increased the resolution to 518 by 518 during the last 10,000 training steps.\n\nResults: DINOv2 outperformed self-supervised vision transformers and weakly supervised vision transformers that use text annotations such as captions as labels (for example CLIP and OpenCLIP ). The authors compared the models on a variety of tasks including image classification, video classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. In each case, they froze DINOv2 and fine-tuned a linear classification layer on top of it.\n\n• DINOv2 achieved 86.3 percent accuracy on ImageNet, while CLIP achieved 85.3 percent accuracy. A fine-tuned MAE achieved 85.9 percent accuracy. DINOv2 and CLIP had 300 million parameters. MAE had 632 million parameters.\n\n• Given 8 evenly spaced video frames, DINOv2 learned to classify videos into 101 categories of actions such as ice dancing, surfing, diving) with 91.2 percent accuracy.

The original DINO showed that a vision transformer pretrained on unlabeled images could learn representations that were sufficient for classifying and segmenting images. In an update of that work, the model learned representations useful in a wider variety of tasks.

What’s new: Maxime Oquab, Timothée Darcet, Théo Moutakanni, and colleagues at Meta and France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology released DINOv2 , a vision transformer pretrained in a self-supervised manner that performs video classification, image retrieval, depth estimation and other vision tasks.

Key insight: Datasets of images scraped from the web can be very large, but they can also be surprisingly undiverse (for example, mostly pictures of pets). Images from smaller datasets that are known to be diverse can be used to find similar images on the web. In this way, it’s possible to scrape a large, diverse image dataset to train vision models using self-supervised methods.

How it works: The authors gathered 142 million images with diversity similar to curated data sets. They pretrained DINOv2, a large vision transformer (ViT) to embed the images using two loss functions gleaned from previous work.

• The authors started with 1.2 billion uncurated images. They used smaller curated datasets such as ImageNet-22k (14.2 million images), ImageNet-1k (1.2 million), and Google Landmarks (4.1 million) to select a certain number of similar ones. They considered two images to be similar based on the cosine-similarity of embeddings computed by ViT-H/16 pretrained on ImageNet-22k.

• Following the original DINO , the authors compared DINOv2’s classification to a teacher model’s classification. Specifically, they added an extra vanilla neural network and pretrained DINOv2 to match its classification of a cropped image to the teacher’s classification of a different crop of the same image. The teacher’s weights were the exponential moving average (average where the most recent versions matter exponentially more than the past ones) of iterations of DINOv2 earlier in the training process.

• Following iBOT , they added a second vanilla neural network and pretrained DINOv2 to match its embeddings of a masked image’s patches to the teacher’s embeddings of the unmasked image’s patches.

• Training on such a large image dataset took a lot of time, so the authors devised 9 methods to accelerate pretraining. For instance, they trained DINOv2 on images at low resolution (224 by 224 pixels) for most of the process. To enable DINOv2 to learn image details, they increased the resolution to 518 by 518 during the last 10,000 training steps.

Results: DINOv2 outperformed self-supervised vision transformers and weakly supervised vision transformers that use text annotations such as captions as labels (for example CLIP and OpenCLIP ). The authors compared the models on a variety of tasks including image classification, video classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation. In each case, they froze DINOv2 and fine-tuned a linear classification layer on top of it.

• DINOv2 achieved 86.3 percent accuracy on ImageNet, while CLIP achieved 85.3 percent accuracy. A fine-tuned MAE achieved 85.9 percent accuracy. DINOv2 and CLIP had 300 million parameters. MAE had 632 million parameters.

• Given 8 evenly spaced video frames, DINOv2 learned to classify videos into 101 categories of actions such as ice dancing, surfing, diving) with 91.2 percent accuracy. OpenCLIP achieved 90.7 percent accuracy, and DINO 85.0 percent accuracy. DINOv2 had around 1 billion parameters, OpenCLIP 1.8 billion, and DINO 87 million.

• Performing semantic segmentation (in which a model predicts to which object the pixels in an image belong to), DINOv2 fine-tuned on CityScapes achieved 71.3 mean IoU (intersection over union, the overlap between the predicted region and the ground-truth region, higher is better) over all object types in the CityScapes test set. DINO achieved 56.9 mean IoU, and OpenCLIP achieved 60.3 mean IoU. Parameter counts were the same as above.

• Performing depth estimation, DINOv2 fine-tuned on KITTI achieved a 2.62 RMSE (root mean squared error, lower is better). DINO achieved 3.81 RMSE and OpenCLIP achieved 3.57 RMSE. Parameter counts were the same as above.

Why it matters: Self-supervised training on massive, diverse datasets has proven potent in language models. Similarly, existing self-supervised methods can deliver great image embeddings when trained on sufficiently large and diverse image datasets.

This approach leveraged the diversity of curated datasets to create a vast yet varied dataset suitable for self-supervised learning. This was a key insight because it helped overcome the limitation that large, web-scraped image datasets can often be undiverse, and contributed to the strong performance of DINOv2 across a range of vision tasks by providing it with a rich and varied set of training examples, ultimately leading to improved and robust image embeddings.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.8545837582258261,1.0,0.9726146805823578,0.8904587223294312

OpenAI adopts Model Context Protocol to boost LLM tool integration
OpenAI embraced Model Context Protocol, providing powerful support for an open standard that connects large language models to tools and data.

What’s new: OpenAI will support Model Context Protocol (MCP) in its Agents SDK and soon its ChatGPT desktop app and Responses API. The move will give developers who use OpenAI models access to a wide variety of pre-existing tools and proprietary data sources.

How it works: Launched by Anthropic late last year, MCP connects AI models to a growing ecosystem of plug-and-play resources, including more than 6,000 community-built servers and connectors .

• MCP defines clients and servers. Servers expose tools and data sources that LLMs can use. Clients like Claude for Desktop or agents built using the OpenAI Agents SDK interact with servers.

• Servers define tools such as internet search or file system manipulation, and users can download and run them locally or connect to servers hosted by third parties. In their code, users simply tell the client where the server(s) are running. Given a prompt, a model, behind the scenes, will retrieve a list of tools available from all servers, decide which to use, call them, and formulate and return responses.

Behind the news: Momentum behind MCP has built rapidly. Last month, Microsoft integrated MCP into CoPilot Studio, enabling developers to build agents with access to MCP servers. Cloudflare enabled its customers to deploy remote MCP servers . In February, the AI-powered code editor Cursor enabled users to add MCP servers .

Why it matters: OpenAI’s move will make it easier for developers who use its models to connect to a variety of tools and data sources, and it helps to establish MCP as a go-to protocol for building agentic applications. Instead of figuring out manually how to integrate various providers, developers can connect to a third-party server (or download and run it themselves) and tie it into existing workflows with a few lines of code.

MCP delineates how clients (like those built with OpenAI's Agents SDK) and servers interact, where servers expose tools and data sources that LLMs can leverage. This structure allows LLMs to seamlessly retrieve a list of available tools, decide on their utility, and utilize them to process prompts and formulate responses.

For developers, this integration alleviates previous challenges of manually figuring out how to incorporate various third-party tools and data sources into their applications. Instead, MCP allows for streamlined access to a wide range of pre-existing resources by simply connecting to community-built or proprietary MCP servers – thereby reducing development time and complexity. Ultimately, OpenAI's move fosters an environment where developers can efficiently build agentic applications with expansive capabilities using LLMs, democratizing access to advanced AI tools and data within existing workflows.",0.9999999999,1.0,0.8990649677062713,1.0,0.6668879941961281,0.9532662624987982

Specifically, the architecture replaces the typical transformer's fully connected layer with a selection from multiple fully connected layers, determined by a hyperparameter. A softmax layer computes the probability of each layer being the most suitable for processing the input token, selecting one to use. These fully connected layers process tokens in parallel, and a special loss function encourages equal activity among them to ensure an even load distribution across hardware cores.
